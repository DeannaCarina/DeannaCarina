## Introduction

This is a webpage to secure the domain name of "DeannaCarina.com" it is not a resume or a portfolio of work, however it has the potential to become that in the future.
At the moment it's main purpose is to redirect people to my other social media/software development platforms: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DeannaCarina" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DeannaCarina" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deannacarina/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.<br><br>
